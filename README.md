# Week 1 lab question
## Task 1._"Live Music Archive"_ðŸ˜ƒ

Almostly, I don't have a specific song or artist that I want to study, but I hope to find the answer in my upcoming music analysis experiments.
## Task 2.
**Challenges working with music data:**
+ Data fragmentation: Music data is distributed on various platforms, and copyright also restricts data access. (If you ask me to recreate a live music form the 19th century, the difficulty should not be easier than writing a 5k words essay!ðŸ˜‚)
+ Curation difficulties: Music type, emotion, and style are difficult to record in astandardlized manner. The track list, stadium info, and audience response are all the more so.
+ Inefficiencies: Is the interoperability between platforms sufficient? So that the efficient distribution of live music is a question. Does it rely on special technologies or intermediary agencies?
  
**How live music exemplifies?**

Live music is usually brief and not repeated, making it difficult to continuously record and analyze a single performance. Moreover, there are a large number of participants in live music activities, including musicians, stage managers, ticketing platforms, audiences, etc. If there is a lack of standardlized recording methods, tremendous live music archives will be difficult to preserve, which is a cultural loss.

**How it is presented in three types of data?**
+ Descriptive data: These data can come from event websites, social media, fan comments, etc. It includes the band members, time and location, performance theme. It describes objective background and qualitative information about live music.
+ Notated data: This can be the score or MIDI data of the performance piece. We can analyze the music structure through these and modify it. However, recording of live music is not easy and requires questioning of accuracy.
+ Acoustic data: Including on-site audio recordings, audio analysis tables, and so on. It may come from some official websites or products. Due to the particularity of live music, there may be noise and sound quality issues.
