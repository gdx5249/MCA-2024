# \[Week 1 lab question\]
## \[2."Live Music Archive"（This may be the topic I need to survey, but I'm not sure :rofl:）\]
## \[3.I think many music data cannot be well stored together due to differences in age, encoding format, file size, and other factors. Not to mention whether the data itself is damaged. :sweat_smile: Live music has immediacy, and considering factors such as on-site noise and equipment conditions, it is almost impossible to perfectly replicate this type of music. In the later analysis of music, I think it will also be quite difficult.\]
